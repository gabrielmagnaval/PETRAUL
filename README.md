This repository contains the supplementary information SI3 of the article 'Development of an Analytical Model of Automobile Energy Consumption During Use-Phase for Parametrized Life Cycle Assessment'.

This paper develops and validates the tool PETRAUL 
PETRAUL is a tool for calculating automobile energy consumption for both gasoline vehicles (GV) and battery electric vehicles (BEV) based on a parametrized model and pre-set configurations.

Repository contents:
Supplementary Information SI3: PETRAUL code and Jupyter Notebooks used in the study, organized into four files:
3A: Preparation of the pre-set configurations for gasoline engines, electric engines, and drivetrain
3B: Preparation of the pre-set configurations for the path and the driver
3C: Model validation, including the collection of EC data from the literature and its comparison with the theoretical model
3D: PETRAUL code and pre-set configurations, along with a Jupyter Notebook featuring illustrative cases
